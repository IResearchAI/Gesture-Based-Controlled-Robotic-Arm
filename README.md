Gesture based arduino controlled Prosthetic Robotic Arm. 
The control signal to a servo motor is a digital PWM signal with a 50Hz frame
rate. The servo pulses are about 1ms long. Therefore, they are driven by
frequencies around 1kHz which is generated by software.

The PWM of the Arduino outputs is for variable power outputs with duty cycle
range - 5% for 1ms and 10% for 2ms at 50Hz for pulse width of 1ms to 2ms
variation.
Initially servo position is set to 0 degree, a pulse of 1.5ms will move the finger to 90
degree. However, these values vary depending on tension.
